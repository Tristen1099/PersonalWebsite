			<h2>Types of Dinos</h2>

			<h4>Tyrannosaurs</h4>

				Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs that ever lived. Everything about this
				ferocious predator, from its thick, heavy skull to its 4-foot-long (1.2-meter-long) jaw, was designed
				for maximum bone-crushing action.

			<h4>Triceratops</h4>

			<div class="details">

				</a>

				The Triceratops is easily recognized thanks to the three horns found on its face as well as its large
				body and the unique frill around its head. The name ‘Triceratops’ comes from the Greek language, with
				‘tri’ meaning three and ‘keratops’ meaning horned face.

			<h4>Stegosaurus</h4>

			<div class="details">

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus">

					<img class="floatleft" src="images/Stegosaurus.png" alt="Stegosaurus" width="200" height="200"></a>

				Stegosaurus was a large, plant-eating dinosaur that was about the size of a bus and carried around two
				rows of bony plates along its back that made it appear even bigger.

			</div>

			<h4>Velociraptor</h4>

			<div class="details">

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor">

					<img class="floatleft" src="images/Velociraptor.png" alt="Velociraptor" width="200"
						height="200"></a>

				Velociraptor comes from the Latin words "velox" (swift) and "raptor" (robber or plunderer). A member of
				the Dromaeosauridae family of small- to medium-sized birdlike dinosaurs, Velociraptor was roughly the
				size of a small turkey and smaller than others in this family of dinosaurs.

			<h4>Plesiosaurus</h4>

			<div class="details">


				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosauria">

					<img class="floatleft" src="images/Plesiosaur.png" alt="Plesiosaur" width="200" height="200"></a>

				Plesiosaurs were large, marine reptiles from the Mesozoic Era that ranged in size from 8-46 feet long
				(2.5-14 m). They had four flippers, sharp teeth in strong jaws, and short, pointed tails. Plesiosaurs
				may have evolved from the Nothosaurs or Pistosaurus, a mid-Triassic reptile.

			<h4>Pachycephalosaurus</h4>

			<div class="details">


				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurus">

					<img class="floatleft" src="images/Pachycephalosaurus.png" alt="Pachycephalosaurus" width="200"
						height="200"></a>

				Pachycephalosaurus; (meaning "thick-headed lizard," from Greek pachys "thick", kephale "head" and sauros
				"lizard") is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaurs. It lived during the Late Cretaceous Period
				(Maastrichtian stage) of what is now North America. It was an herbivorous creature which is primarily
				known for its thick skull which was believed to be used in intra-species combat.
